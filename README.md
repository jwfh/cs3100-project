_**This GitHub repository contains the Num Hub site, a NodeJS-built website running with Docker to satisfy the course project requirement of Computer Science 3100 at Memorial University.**_

# NUM HUB
_Num Hub_ is a website targeted to teachers and professors of mathematics and is used to share math problems. Our aim is to help educators collaborate to create new and engaging math problems for student practice and homework sheets, as well as formal examinations. 

# USAGE
## ACCESS
Users of the website may browse questions by category or use the search bar to find specific questions without registering for an account or signing in.

To access answers to published questions or to publish new questions, users must create an account using the registration page and then sign in.

## PUBLISHING
Contributing to _Num Hub_'s question bank may only be done if you have authenticated. 

To add questions to the question bank, follow the instructions below.
1. Click the **New** button at the top right-hand side of the webpage. 
2. Select the education level and category in which the question will be posted.
3. Give your question a title and type the question in the large textbox.
4. Optionally, add one or more solutions to your problem.
5. Save your question by clicking **Submit to Questionbank**.

## FORMATTING
Questions may be formatted with Markdown to achieve **bold face** or _oblique_ text. Mathematical symbols should be typeset between two dollar signs ($) to invoke LaTeX-like typesetting syntax.

For example, one may write 
    
    Provide a _counterexample_ to the claim that $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ is 
    $f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. State the **correct mapping**.
    
## GRAPHICS
Images may be linked using Markdown syntax or uploaded using the **Upload Image** button. Uploaded images must be in JPEG or PNG format and must be below 1024KB. Images uploaded undergo compression and the resultant file is accessible via a generated link that is automatically inserted, with Markdown image markup, at the location of the cursor in the text pane.
